# Swerve-Drive-2022
FRC Team 3863's Swerve Drive Code for 2022

This code was written for our prototype swerve module, but documented so that it could be used with SDS modules or after alterations in the future.
The prototype is using a Neo with a Spark Max for the drive motor and a 775 Pro with a Talon SRX for steering.

The project includes:
- Fully working Field-Oriented Swerve during Teleop using SwerveDriveKinematics.
- Our own vector-based odometry.
- PathPlanner trajectory and path following for fully working (Tuning WIP) autonomous path following.
